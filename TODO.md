To-Do List
==========

This is a list of AlPad "To Do" items.

Bugs
----

* [Command][M] doesn't work
* don't delete blank lines in the (un-)indent methods
* i'm adding all the listeners to each textarea, which seems right; but review
  how this works with the menubar; that is, am i constantly changing the menubar?
* if i rearrange the code I can get all of the actions out of the global namespace

Features
--------

* auto complete with tab/esc (like TextMate)
* add a string of 10 or 20 characters like "---------" or "=======" or "~~~~~~~~~" with single keystroke
