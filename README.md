AlPad
=====

Don't worry about this project, there's nothing to see here ...

Okay, what this project is, is a simple "Scratchpad" text editor.
I originally thought I just wanted an extremely simple text editor,
but then I decided I wanted tabs so I could have multiple text areas,
then I wanted to convert tabs in the text to spaces, then I wanted to
be able to indent text, un-indent text, undo/redo changes, and I think
that might be it.

I originally named this project "Pasty" because I thought I would
be mostly pasting in-to and out-of the editor, but I think 
"AlPad" is probably a better name for what it's grown into.

As one important point, this editor does not write to the disk or
read from the disk. As both names imply, I just want this editor running
on the side so I can use it as a scratchpad thing.

I'm also using this project to get more comfortable using ProGuard,
in particular from within an Ant build script.


Compiling/Building
------------------

At the moment, use this script to compile and run the app:

    _buildRun.sh

I've only built this on one system, so I think there may be a build
problem related to the _classes_ directory that the build script uses.
If you run into any problems with the build script, just make the
_classes_ directory manually if necessary, and that may resolve the
problem.
